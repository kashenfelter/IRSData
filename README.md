## IRSData
R Code for IRS Data Management

The IRS publishes summary data at the zip code (5 digit) level. It can be accessed for download at https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2015-zip-code-data-soi.


From the IRS SOI documentation (available on the same page as above):

*The Statistics of Income (SOI) division bases its ZIP code data on administrative records of individual income tax returns (Forms 1040) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Individual Master File (IMF) system. Included in these data are returns filed during the 12-month period, January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. While the bulk of returns filed during the 12-month period are primarily for Tax Year 2015, the IRS received a limited number of returns for tax years before 2015 and these have been included within the ZIP code data.*

The rest of the documentation provides context to the data, as well as a set of caveats to its interpretation.
